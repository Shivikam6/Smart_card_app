The main concern of this project is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the whole system.

The main objectives of using Relational Database Management System are as follows: 


1. CONTROL REDUNDANCY  :  The  System should identify existence of common data and avoid duplicate recording relationships of pointers should be used to locate data which are used many times selective redundancy is sometimes allowed to improve performance or far better reliability.

2. DATA INTEGRITY  :  Consistency of data values and relationships must be preserved in order to achieve this the system must ensure validity of data by using good editing, synchronize updating and propagating changes to other related data element it also involves maintaining audit trails to enable recovery if errors are deleted.

3.  DATA SECURITY : This is concerned with protecting access to data protection is needed at many levels for access, modification, deletion or display access restriction may be for individual data items or group of items.

4. DATABASE PERFORMANCE: The system should be able to provide timely information as required. The cost of storing and retrieving the data should be commensurate with the value of information provided.

5.  MANAGEMENT CONTROL: As the dependence of an organization on a data base increases positive management controls should be exercised over addition, deletion, changes and disposition of data must be protected to start legal accounting and auditing requirements.
